      Upper Paleolithic Transition

      <h3>40,000 BCE</h3>
      <p>
        The Upper Paleolithic has the earliest known evidence of organized settlements, in the form of campsites, some with storage pits. Artistic work blossomed, with cave painting, petroglyphs, carvings and engravings on bone or ivory. The first evidence of human fishing is also found, from artefacts in places such as Blombos cave in South Africa. More complex social groupings emerged, supported by more varied and reliable food sources and specialized tool types. This probably contributed to increasing group identification or ethnicity (from Wikipedia).

            Shamanism
          </h3>
          <blockquote>
            "One thing's for sure: shamaism is the best medical care you're
            going to get for a long time."
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            Shamanism begins around this time. The shaman engages in
            disruptive practices, participatory play, and psychedelics to
            heal, lead, and cousel their tribespeople. They harness the
            <a href="#the-flow-state">flow-state</a> and implicit
            learning to have intuitive understandings of patterns in their
            environments and in the tribe.
          </p>
          <p>
            The shaman is getting into the flow state, getting an insight
            cascade and super-enhanced implicit learning, picking up on real,
            complex patterns in the environment. These two things reinforce
            each other. but some challenges arise.
          </p>
          <p>
            They don't know how they're doing it, they're transcending
            themselves, they have intuitive insights—healing people, how the
            dear moves, etc.—and they can't communicate any of their
            knowledge. The shaman is healing and transforming people, they're
            dancing, singing, and chanting, and it's is making meaning.
            They're altering people's sense of what matters.
          </p>
          <p>
            The brain is putting different parts of itself in communication
            with each other. Normally this would be experienced as noise, but
            with enhanced insight and cognitive processing, its experienced as
            a bridging force, further augmenting pattern recognition. This is
            the capacity for metaphor.
          </p>
          <p>
            This makes shamans generators of metaphor: literally providing
            people with the forms of thought that will allow them to connect
            ideas, such that making inscriptions on caves can track the moon,
            that making a figure will connect you with fertility. They often
            experience soul flight (origin of getting high and the metaphor
            behind the words oversight and supervision).

            The Flow-State
          </h3>
          <p>
            The flow-state happens when: your task is beyond your present
            abilities but not your insights, the task gets harder as your
            abilities improve, coupling between yourself and the task is
            tight, feedback is clear, and failure is meaningful.
          </p>
          <p>
            This state is deeply positive for people, and not becuase it's
            pleasurable. The more time you spend in the flow-state, the more
            likely you are to say your own life is meaningful. Whilst in it,
            you feel deeply at one with things, your actions spontaneously
            flow out of you, time passes differently, your narrative
            self-conscious quiets, the task is super-salient, and, while at
            one level, there is tremendous metabolic effort, it feels
            effortless.
          </p>
          <p>
            People really like this experience. It seems to be not only
            meaningful, but also where they do their best work. Additionally,
            the flow-state is a universal. Almost everyone from every culture
            reports this state in similar terms. Universals are important
            because they give us clues as to the underlying machinery.
          </p>
          <p>
            This underlying machinery (according to Vervaeke and Ferraro)
            involves transframing, or the process of breaking and reframing
            the task. An example of this is rock climbing. When you're stuck,
            you're physically stuck, and you have to physically reframe
            yourself on the face to move forward.

            Implicit Learning & Intuition
          </h3>
          <p>
            Implicit learning is a capacity, outside of your conscious
            awareness, to pick up on very complicated patterns in your
            environment. Arthur Reber (60s) conducted an experiment with two
            sets of random rules for generating long strings, asking people to
            sort them into sets. They performed well above chance.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hogarth, in <em>Educating Intuition</em>, says that what we call
            intuition is real, but that there isn't anything magical about it.
            It's just the result of your implicit learning. We call it
            intuition is when it's going well, and bias or prejudice is when
            it's going wrong. He argues that the difference lies in the kind
            of pattern picked up.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are two kinds of pattern in your environment: correlational
            and causal. The bigot has picked up on
            <em>correlational</em> patterns, not causal patterns. You need to
            train your implicit learning to look for causal patterns. But you
            cannot be told to look for patterns or your performance gets
            worse. Implicit learning cannot be replaced by explicit
            learning—its being implicit is why is works so well. What we can
            do is set up the right context, the right environmental factors,
            so that the implicit learning machine can get onto causal rather
            than correlational patterns. (Science is a way to do precisely
            this.)
          </p>
          <p>
            Hogarth says that implicit learning can be encouraged by a
            situation in which the coupling between you and the world is
            tight, feedback is clear, and failure is meaningful—exactly the
            same requirements for the flow-state.

          The Continuous Cosmos
        </h3>
        <p>
          In the Bronze Age, the world was mythologized and experienced as a
          continuous cosmos. People experienced themselves in radical
          continuity and connectedness with eachother and the environment.
          Furthermore, this continuity was extended between the natural world,
          the cultural world, and the divine world. In other words, there was
          not a difference in kind, only in power, between trees, animals,
          humans, and gods.
        </p>
        <p>
          Glorious is the word most used to describe God in the Bible. It
          means only shining with power. There is no moral or riteous quality
          to it. The pharos are God-kings, something <em>like</em> a god. It's
          not a metaphor for the Egyptians, there's just a difference in
          power.
        </p>
        <p>
          But this cosmos is continuous in another way: it folds on itself.
          Time moves in large cycles that repeat for eternity, and ritual
          behavior is an attempt to get back to the original power of
          creation—to tap into that creative power. There's a constant
          nostalgia to get back, to fit into the cycles, beacause if you
          change your future too much, you undermine your past.

          <p>
            Progress exapts our capacity for storytelling and uses it to
            understand time and moral participation in history. It claims that
            time is a story, a narrative, that it has a beginning, a turning
            point, and a resolution, that there's a direction and a purpose to
            it. The continuous cosmos did not have an open future; this does.

            The way that your actions change your future is by your

            history. Since story operates through meaning and moraltiy, the
            morality of your actions changes the future. This is exemplified

            Kairos & Da'ath
          </h3>
          <p>
            Kairos is the technical term for these turning points the in the
            narrative of time in which one can participate with God in the
            creation of the future. They involve a particular kind of faith:
            da'ath. This is the sort of participatory knowing which is used as
            a biblical metaphor for sex. You shape it, and it shapes you,
            there's a turning point and a climax, a course.
          </p>
          <p>
            You have this sort of knowing with respect to questions like: How
            are things going? Is this relationship progressing? Am I growing
            as a person? This is da'ath. You know it by identifying with it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Tresspassing is walking off the moral course of history, a
            movement backwards, away from the promised land. This is what it
            means to sin, and this is Christianity's answer to the problem of
            self-deception—that we sin, decieve ourselves, constantly without
            knowing it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since, periodically, God has to intervene in the course of things,
            prophets become central. Prophecy is not someone telling the
            future; it's when you and your loved one go to therapy, and the
            therapist says something that wakes you up, that makes you realize
            how you can get back on track.
          </p>
          <p>
            All of this begins to craft a focus on remembering God,
            participating in the ongoing creation of the world, helping your
            neighbors, yourself, and your culture to live up to its promise.
            Do you feel like you're living up to your promise? If this is
            important to you, then you use the grammar of the Hebrews.
          </p>
          <p>
            What the Christians uniquely claimed was that kairos was found in
            a particular person, personalizing all of this in a peculiar way.

            The Natural Philosophers, of whom Thales is a prime example, were one of the groups that Socrates sought out on his quest. Thales' body of work, of which we have only fragments, can be summed up in three lines.
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            All is the moist.
            The loadstone has psyche.
            Everything is filled with Gods.
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            Thales first inquires about the substance of everything, about getting in and underneath the world, to figure out what it's made of. And there's no myth here; this is not a story, not a narrative explanation, he's making a rational, empirical attempt to understand the cosmos. What he's inventing is scientific thought.
          </p>
          <p>
            The last line could be misread easily by modern eyes. Thales is attempting to communicate the awe and wonder that analysis into the fabric of reality, into making sense of reality, of what's most sacred and inexhaustible, provokes.

            If there are two people who epitomize the Axial Revolution in Greece, one is Pythagoras, and the other is Socrates. Pythagoras belonged to a group of individuals who were just emerging from the dark ages called The Divine Men. The seemed to represent a rediscovery of <a href="#shamanism" >shamanic psychotechnologies</a>. Much known about them is mythological and legendary. But Pythagoras was very real.
          </p>
          <p>
            Pythagoras seems to have gone through shamanic training: he went into a cave, and emerged radically transformed. He was very tall, and he dressed like a god, though no one seemed to have minded.
          </p>
          <p>
            He discovers the octave, and with it the fact that there are mathematical proportions in the world. He discovers that these new psychotechnologies of rational argumentation give us access to abstract patterns we are not directly aware of. He takes this idea of realizing abstract patterns and links them to the shamanic practices, saying we are somehow trapped in this world, but that we can learn to fly free, like the shaman.
          </p>
          <p>
            He linked the path of self-transcendence to the realization of abstract patterns. He gives us words like cosmos (seen in cosmetics: to reveal the beauty of things). Pythagoras said that following him would lead to our transcending ourselves, experiencing the world as ordered and beautiful. Thus, shamanic soul flight is transformed into a radical self-transcendence towards the real world that dictates the abstract figures of reality.

            Socrates was an enigmatic, provocative, and maddeningly frustrating figure. He is equally so with respect to scholarly attempts to get clear on his history. Some followers of his went to the oracle at Delphi and asked whether there was any man wiser than Socrates.

            He presents us with an interesting character, which appears to have been shamanic to a large extent, carrying on the mythos of the shamanic psychotechnologies: long meditations, inhuman bravery and ability to withstand pain, cold, and hunger.

              Elenchus is the name given to the Socratic Method. Socrates would go to anyone claiming to have wisdom or knowledge, or to any tradesman, nobleman, etc., and ask them questions. "Why are you buying those goods? Oh, because they will bring you pleasure? Then you must know what pleasure is, please, tell me? And how can you tell which among them is good as opposed to bad, surely you must know what the good is?" and so on.
            </p>
            <p>
              The state that his interlocutors eventually reached is called aporia. It's like being stung by a sting ray, confused, lost, paralyzed, utterly unable to continue the discussion. Socrates believed at some point to have completed his quest. He knew what he did not know. Not in the sense that one does not know the intricacies of quantum physics, but in the sense of <a href="#kairos-&-daath" >da'ath</a>. Socrates has a deep sense of his own cognitive mechanisms and how self-deceptive they can be.

              Socrates had figured out that our actions are constantly racing ahead of our knowledge. We are buying things, and we <em>don't know why</em>. We want and we do and we get angry and we fall in love and we <em>don't know what's going on</em>.

They did not care what the argument was for, only that it could be delivered well. See <a href="#bullshit" >bullshit</a> for more information.

            <p>
              They were paid to teach citizens and prepare their speeches for democratic presentation. They would teach one man to argue for an augmentation of the Athenian navy and another for its diminuation.

            <p>
              Socrates understood that while we cannot lie to ourselves, we can bullshit ourselves. You cannot volitionally believe. If asked to believe there's an elephant in the room, though you know there is not. You cannot do it. The liar thus depends on your commitment to the truth. And, though you can direct your attention, it can also be caught. The bullshit artist depends on your self-deception, on your sense of salience, on your caught attention, overpowering your commitment to the truth.
            </p>
            <p>
              There is a feedback loop which occurs with attention: your attention is captured by something, so it becomes more salient in the future, you are more caught by it, so it is more salient, and so on until you loose the capacity to notice or think about other things. This is the engine of bullshit.
            </p>
            <p>
              Rhetoric is a psychotechnology of bullshit. It is the explicit, trained capacity to bullshit your listeners. It is the beginning of advertising. You know that life is not like a beer commercial. If you walked into a bar, and it was like a beer commercial, you would question your sanity. Nonetheless, you buy the beer, the advertisement is still effective; the reason is rhetoric and our capacity for our actions and desires to become very salient to us way before we understand them, our capacity to bullshit ourselves and to be bullshit by others.

He thought that what makes life worth living is caring about the things which matter, finding relevant, desireable, and tempting things which are actually known by onself to be truly good.
            </p>
            <p>
              Socrates claimed that he knew how to love well (ta erotika), or desire or want well. In short he claims to have gotten his relevance machinery and his truth oriented-ness to work together. He knew how reason and love go together. He was lucky to have a great disciple in Plato.

              Socrates is eventually put on trial for corrupting the youth and atheism, which is at this time not the disbelief in Gods but the teaching of strange Gods. It appears that he made friends with trouble-makers and made enemies of powerful political elite, though the exact reasons for his trial are unclear. 
            </p>

              He explains his quest and the oracle's declaration, and makes his case largely in the style he is accustomed to, which is not what the jury is used to. He is found guilty by a very slim majority. At this point each side suggests a punishment to be voted on. The prosecutors suggest death, and Socrates says that the unexamined life is not worth living and suggests that his punishment be to continue doing philosophy, as it has cost him greatly: the admonition of his state, a lack of political power, etc. So, Socrates proposes that Athens give him free housing and food for life so that he can continue doing the grueling work of philosophy.

            <p>
              Inner conflict; this is Plato's answer to the question of foolishness, and with it he crafts the first true psychological account—one which will remain present with us today. He comes up with the idea that we have different centers in the psyche, each with a different perspective on the world and on ourselves.
            </p>
            <p>
              There's a man in your head who is truth-oriented and reasoning, deals with abstract entities, and plans long-term. This man has cognitive access to things like health, weight, sense of progress, financial security, etc.
            </p>
            <p>
              There's a lion in your chest that is honor- and shame-motivated, deals in social and cutlural entities, shared and socially agreed-upon goals, and cultural meanings, and plans in the intermediate-term. It is called the thymos, or the piece of you which is socially motivated.
            </p>
            <p>
              Finally there is a monster in your stomach and genitals that deals in pleasure and pain, is very short-term, salience, motivated, and cannot plan.
            </p>
            <p>
              When these centers of your self are out of balance or in conflict, one can race ahead of the other, the monster can overpower the man easily, or the lion for that matter. The man is not very powerful in fact. Plato had a reasonable explanation for foolishness which is in the very bones of our society. We take this for granted, this notion of inner conflict between our simple, unplanning, pleasure-pain reactions and our reasoned plans and social agreements. He invented it.
            </p>
            <p>
              While Socrates practiced getting people to realize that what they found salient was getting way ahead of what they understood to be true, Plato offered a rational explanation.
            </p>
            <p>
              Plato had the great idea that the man can learn and theorize, he can train the lion, and the man and the lion together can tame the monster. This is an optimization strategy, and you want each part to operate as fully as possible without hurting the others. This brings a fullness of being and peace for Plato, and it represents a meta-drive for humans: we want to have what we are having but to be at peace, without inner-conflict.
            </p>
            <p>
              It doesn't go without saying that this path to fullness of being or inner-justice is a positive feedback loop. The more the man learns and trains the lion, the less self-deception and violence obscure the man and lion's path, the more the monster can be tamed. This will be further explained in <a href="#the-allegory-of-the-cave" >The Allegory of the Cave</a>.

              Cognitive Discounting
            </h3>
            <p>
              The relative strength or salience of each part of your psyche, as described by Plato, is found across species. In fact it's very adaptive, and it accounts for something called cognitive discounting.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is your automatic reduction in the salience of a stimulus. Things in the future are much less salient to you than things in the present. A lion now is a much more important fact than a lion in two weeks. If the lion two weeks from now were more important than the one in front of you, you wouldn't last very long at all.
            </p>
            <p>
              This makes sense because any single event in the future, as it gets further away, becomes less likely—there are simply more things that could happen. If this wasn't functioning properly, you wouldn't get out of bed, because you'd be thinking that you might twist your ankle, which would slow you down to class, and if you're late to class you might get worse grades, fail your career and wind up married to a lamp in Buffallo. That end result which is highly unlikely should not be as salient to you as getting up out of bed. Generalized anxiety disorder might be a failure of this kind.
            </p>
            <p>
              But what we need is a way to realize the abstract similarities of particular end results. The likelihood of each particular future death, if you were to start smoking now, is low, but we need to be able to realize that there are a great many of those particular deaths, realize that they are all related to present actions, and treat them as accordingly important.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is a basic problem with adaptive machinery. They work short term and concretely but blind you to what low probability things abstractly have in common.
            </p>
            <p>
              The unavoidable reality is that you can't throw away the adaptive machinery, and you can't just let it run unfettered, because then you harm yourself. What you need is an ability to form abstract thoughts about the future and symbolically represent it to yourself such that it can become salient to you now. This is the function of Plato's man in your head.

            <p>
              This is a mythological framework for enlightenment in Plato's psychology which places the path towards inner-peace into the Axial Revolution's two world's mythology. You are inside the cave, but as you ascend, you're blinded and your eyes need time to adjust, then you go a little further, until you reach the surface and attempt to understand the cause of things, of appearances, to get at the shining source of things, the sun, which you cannot stare at or understand directly.

            <p>
              This is the Platonic form, and it's crucial to understand the allegory of the cave and it's relationship with Pythagoras. The eidos of a thing is not its form or idea, it is a real pattern in reality, like a paradigm, and, when you understand the eidos of a thing, you know the thing.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is similar to what we have found with gestalt or logos. A bird is not a feature-list. If I put wings, hollow bones, eyes, and feathers on a table and thow it up in the air, it's not a bird, it's just a bloody mess. Yet you know what a bird is and it comes from your understanding of the structural-functional organization of the features present in a bird. This is gestalt or logos. If I ask you to explain the gestalt or logos, you cannot, yet you know what it is. This is the closest understanding of eidos.
            </p>
            <p>
              Yet it is only once you understand this eidos that you actually really know what a bird is. It is at once what makes a thing itself and what gives your mind access to understanding it, how your mind can <em>conform</em> to the thing.
