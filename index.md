      Upper Paleolithic Transition

      <h3>40,000 BCE</h3>
      <p>
        The Upper Paleolithic has the earliest known evidence of organized settlements, in the form of campsites, some with storage pits. Artistic work blossomed, with cave painting, petroglyphs, carvings and engravings on bone or ivory. The first evidence of human fishing is also found, from artefacts in places such as Blombos cave in South Africa. More complex social groupings emerged, supported by more varied and reliable food sources and specialized tool types. This probably contributed to increasing group identification or ethnicity (from Wikipedia).

            Shamanism
          </h3>
          <blockquote>
            "One thing's for sure: shamaism is the best medical care you're
            going to get for a long time."
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            Shamanism begins around this time. The shaman engages in
            disruptive practices, participatory play, and psychedelics to
            heal, lead, and cousel their tribespeople. They harness the
            <a href="#the-flow-state">flow-state</a> and implicit
            learning to have intuitive understandings of patterns in their
            environments and in the tribe.
          </p>
          <p>
            The shaman is getting into the flow state, getting an insight
            cascade and super-enhanced implicit learning, picking up on real,
            complex patterns in the environment. These two things reinforce
            each other. but some challenges arise.
          </p>
          <p>
            They don't know how they're doing it, they're transcending
            themselves, they have intuitive insights—healing people, how the
            dear moves, etc.—and they can't communicate any of their
            knowledge. The shaman is healing and transforming people, they're
            dancing, singing, and chanting, and it's is making meaning.
            They're altering people's sense of what matters.
          </p>
          <p>
            The brain is putting different parts of itself in communication
            with each other. Normally this would be experienced as noise, but
            with enhanced insight and cognitive processing, its experienced as
            a bridging force, further augmenting pattern recognition. This is
            the capacity for metaphor.
          </p>
          <p>
            This makes shamans generators of metaphor: literally providing
            people with the forms of thought that will allow them to connect
            ideas, such that making inscriptions on caves can track the moon,
            that making a figure will connect you with fertility. They often
            experience soul flight (origin of getting high and the metaphor
            behind the words oversight and supervision).

            The Flow-State
          </h3>
          <p>
            The flow-state happens when: your task is beyond your present
            abilities but not your insights, the task gets harder as your
            abilities improve, coupling between yourself and the task is
            tight, feedback is clear, and failure is meaningful.
          </p>
          <p>
            This state is deeply positive for people, and not becuase it's
            pleasurable. The more time you spend in the flow-state, the more
            likely you are to say your own life is meaningful. Whilst in it,
            you feel deeply at one with things, your actions spontaneously
            flow out of you, time passes differently, your narrative
            self-conscious quiets, the task is super-salient, and, while at
            one level, there is tremendous metabolic effort, it feels
            effortless.
          </p>
          <p>
            People really like this experience. It seems to be not only
            meaningful, but also where they do their best work. Additionally,
            the flow-state is a universal. Almost everyone from every culture
            reports this state in similar terms. Universals are important
            because they give us clues as to the underlying machinery.
          </p>
          <p>
            This underlying machinery (according to Vervaeke and Ferraro)
            involves transframing, or the process of breaking and reframing
            the task. An example of this is rock climbing. When you're stuck,
            you're physically stuck, and you have to physically reframe
            yourself on the face to move forward.

            Implicit Learning & Intuition
          </h3>
          <p>
            Implicit learning is a capacity, outside of your conscious
            awareness, to pick up on very complicated patterns in your
            environment. Arthur Reber (60s) conducted an experiment with two
            sets of random rules for generating long strings, asking people to
            sort them into sets. They performed well above chance.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hogarth, in <em>Educating Intuition</em>, says that what we call
            intuition is real, but that there isn't anything magical about it.
            It's just the result of your implicit learning. We call it
            intuition is when it's going well, and bias or prejudice is when
            it's going wrong. He argues that the difference lies in the kind
            of pattern picked up.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are two kinds of pattern in your environment: correlational
            and causal. The bigot has picked up on
            <em>correlational</em> patterns, not causal patterns. You need to
            train your implicit learning to look for causal patterns. But you
            cannot be told to look for patterns or your performance gets
            worse. Implicit learning cannot be replaced by explicit
            learning—its being implicit is why is works so well. What we can
            do is set up the right context, the right environmental factors,
            so that the implicit learning machine can get onto causal rather
            than correlational patterns. (Science is a way to do precisely
            this.)
          </p>
          <p>
            Hogarth says that implicit learning can be encouraged by a
            situation in which the coupling between you and the world is
            tight, feedback is clear, and failure is meaningful—exactly the
            same requirements for the flow-state.

          The Continuous Cosmos
        </h3>
        <p>
          In the Bronze Age, the world was mythologized and experienced as a
          continuous cosmos. People experienced themselves in radical
          continuity and connectedness with eachother and the environment.
          Furthermore, this continuity was extended between the natural world,
          the cultural world, and the divine world. In other words, there was
          not a difference in kind, only in power, between trees, animals,
          humans, and gods.
        </p>
        <p>
          Glorious is the word most used to describe God in the Bible. It
          means only shining with power. There is no moral or riteous quality
          to it. The pharos are God-kings, something <em>like</em> a god. It's
          not a metaphor for the Egyptians, there's just a difference in
          power.
        </p>
        <p>
          But this cosmos is continuous in another way: it folds on itself.
          Time moves in large cycles that repeat for eternity, and ritual
          behavior is an attempt to get back to the original power of
          creation—to tap into that creative power. There's a constant
          nostalgia to get back, to fit into the cycles, beacause if you
          change your future too much, you undermine your past.

          <p>
            Progress exapts our capacity for storytelling and uses it to
            understand time and moral participation in history. It claims that
            time is a story, a narrative, that it has a beginning, a turning
            point, and a resolution, that there's a direction and a purpose to
            it. The continuous cosmos did not have an open future; this does.

            The way that your actions change your future is by your

            history. Since story operates through meaning and moraltiy, the
            morality of your actions changes the future. This is exemplified

            Kairos & Da'ath
          </h3>
          <p>
            Kairos is the technical term for these turning points the in the
            narrative of time in which one can participate with God in the
            creation of the future. They involve a particular kind of faith:
            da'ath. This is the sort of participatory knowing which is used as
            a biblical metaphor for sex. You shape it, and it shapes you,
            there's a turning point and a climax, a course.
          </p>
          <p>
            You have this sort of knowing with respect to questions like: How
            are things going? Is this relationship progressing? Am I growing
            as a person? This is da'ath. You know it by identifying with it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Tresspassing is walking off the moral course of history, a
            movement backwards, away from the promised land. This is what it
            means to sin, and this is Christianity's answer to the problem of
            self-deception—that we sin, decieve ourselves, constantly without
            knowing it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since, periodically, God has to intervene in the course of things,
            prophets become central. Prophecy is not someone telling the
            future; it's when you and your loved one go to therapy, and the
            therapist says something that wakes you up, that makes you realize
            how you can get back on track.
          </p>
          <p>
            All of this begins to craft a focus on remembering God,
            participating in the ongoing creation of the world, helping your
            neighbors, yourself, and your culture to live up to its promise.
            Do you feel like you're living up to your promise? If this is
            important to you, then you use the grammar of the Hebrews.
          </p>
          <p>
            What the Christians uniquely claimed was that kairos was found in
            a particular person, personalizing all of this in a peculiar way.

            The Natural Philosophers, of whom Thales is a prime example, were one of the groups that Socrates sought out on his quest. Thales' body of work, of which we have only fragments, can be summed up in three lines.
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            All is the moist.
            The loadstone has psyche.
            Everything is filled with Gods.
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            Thales first inquires about the substance of everything, about getting in and underneath the world, to figure out what it's made of. And there's no myth here; this is not a story, not a narrative explanation, he's making a rational, empirical attempt to understand the cosmos. What he's inventing is scientific thought.
          </p>
          <p>
            The last line could be misread easily by modern eyes. Thales is attempting to communicate the awe and wonder that analysis into the fabric of reality, into making sense of reality, of what's most sacred and inexhaustible, provokes.

            If there are two people who epitomize the Axial Revolution in Greece, one is Pythagoras, and the other is Socrates. Pythagoras belonged to a group of individuals who were just emerging from the dark ages called The Divine Men. The seemed to represent a rediscovery of <a href="#shamanism" >shamanic psychotechnologies</a>. Much known about them is mythological and legendary. But Pythagoras was very real.
          </p>
          <p>
            Pythagoras seems to have gone through shamanic training: he went into a cave, and emerged radically transformed. He was very tall, and he dressed like a god, though no one seemed to have minded.
          </p>
          <p>
            He discovers the octave, and with it the fact that there are mathematical proportions in the world. He discovers that these new psychotechnologies of rational argumentation give us access to abstract patterns we are not directly aware of. He takes this idea of realizing abstract patterns and links them to the shamanic practices, saying we are somehow trapped in this world, but that we can learn to fly free, like the shaman.
          </p>
          <p>
            He linked the path of self-transcendence to the realization of abstract patterns. He gives us words like cosmos (seen in cosmetics: to reveal the beauty of things). Pythagoras said that following him would lead to our transcending ourselves, experiencing the world as ordered and beautiful. Thus, shamanic soul flight is transformed into a radical self-transcendence towards the real world that dictates the abstract figures of reality.

            Socrates was an enigmatic, provocative, and maddeningly frustrating figure. He is equally so with respect to scholarly attempts to get clear on his history. Some followers of his went to the oracle at Delphi and asked whether there was any man wiser than Socrates.

            He presents us with an interesting character, which appears to have been shamanic to a large extent, carrying on the mythos of the shamanic psychotechnologies: long meditations, inhuman bravery and ability to withstand pain, cold, and hunger.

              Elenchus is the name given to the Socratic Method. Socrates would go to anyone claiming to have wisdom or knowledge, or to any tradesman, nobleman, etc., and ask them questions. "Why are you buying those goods? Oh, because they will bring you pleasure? Then you must know what pleasure is, please, tell me? And how can you tell which among them is good as opposed to bad, surely you must know what the good is?" and so on.
            </p>
            <p>
              The state that his interlocutors eventually reached is called aporia. It's like being stung by a sting ray, confused, lost, paralyzed, utterly unable to continue the discussion. Socrates believed at some point to have completed his quest. He knew what he did not know. Not in the sense that one does not know the intricacies of quantum physics, but in the sense of <a href="#kairos-&-daath" >da'ath</a>. Socrates has a deep sense of his own cognitive mechanisms and how self-deceptive they can be.

              Socrates had figured out that our actions are constantly racing ahead of our knowledge. We are buying things, and we <em>don't know why</em>. We want and we do and we get angry and we fall in love and we <em>don't know what's going on</em>.

They did not care what the argument was for, only that it could be delivered well. See <a href="#bullshit" >bullshit</a> for more information.

            <p>
              They were paid to teach citizens and prepare their speeches for democratic presentation. They would teach one man to argue for an augmentation of the Athenian navy and another for its diminuation.

            <p>
              Socrates understood that while we cannot lie to ourselves, we can bullshit ourselves. You cannot volitionally believe. If asked to believe there's an elephant in the room, though you know there is not. You cannot do it. The liar thus depends on your commitment to the truth. And, though you can direct your attention, it can also be caught. The bullshit artist depends on your self-deception, on your sense of salience, on your caught attention, overpowering your commitment to the truth.
            </p>
            <p>
              There is a feedback loop which occurs with attention: your attention is captured by something, so it becomes more salient in the future, you are more caught by it, so it is more salient, and so on until you loose the capacity to notice or think about other things. This is the engine of bullshit.
            </p>
            <p>
              Rhetoric is a psychotechnology of bullshit. It is the explicit, trained capacity to bullshit your listeners. It is the beginning of advertising. You know that life is not like a beer commercial. If you walked into a bar, and it was like a beer commercial, you would question your sanity. Nonetheless, you buy the beer, the advertisement is still effective; the reason is rhetoric and our capacity for our actions and desires to become very salient to us way before we understand them, our capacity to bullshit ourselves and to be bullshit by others.

He thought that what makes life worth living is caring about the things which matter, finding relevant, desireable, and tempting things which are actually known by onself to be truly good.
            </p>
            <p>
              Socrates claimed that he knew how to love well (ta erotika), or desire or want well. In short he claims to have gotten his relevance machinery and his truth oriented-ness to work together. He knew how reason and love go together. He was lucky to have a great disciple in Plato.

              Socrates is eventually put on trial for corrupting the youth and atheism, which is at this time not the disbelief in Gods but the teaching of strange Gods. It appears that he made friends with trouble-makers and made enemies of powerful political elite, though the exact reasons for his trial are unclear. 
            </p>

              He explains his quest and the oracle's declaration, and makes his case largely in the style he is accustomed to, which is not what the jury is used to. He is found guilty by a very slim majority. At this point each side suggests a punishment to be voted on. The prosecutors suggest death, and Socrates says that the unexamined life is not worth living and suggests that his punishment be to continue doing philosophy, as it has cost him greatly: the admonition of his state, a lack of political power, etc. So, Socrates proposes that Athens give him free housing and food for life so that he can continue doing the grueling work of philosophy.

            <p>
              Inner conflict; this is Plato's answer to the question of foolishness, and with it he crafts the first true psychological account—one which will remain present with us today. He comes up with the idea that we have different centers in the psyche, each with a different perspective on the world and on ourselves.
            </p>
            <p>
              There's a man in your head who is truth-oriented and reasoning, deals with abstract entities, and plans long-term. This man has cognitive access to things like health, weight, sense of progress, financial security, etc.
            </p>
            <p>
              There's a lion in your chest that is honor- and shame-motivated, deals in social and cutlural entities, shared and socially agreed-upon goals, and cultural meanings, and plans in the intermediate-term. It is called the thymos, or the piece of you which is socially motivated.
            </p>
            <p>
              Finally there is a monster in your stomach and genitals that deals in pleasure and pain, is very short-term, salience, motivated, and cannot plan.
            </p>
            <p>
              When these centers of your self are out of balance or in conflict, one can race ahead of the other, the monster can overpower the man easily, or the lion for that matter. The man is not very powerful in fact. Plato had a reasonable explanation for foolishness which is in the very bones of our society. We take this for granted, this notion of inner conflict between our simple, unplanning, pleasure-pain reactions and our reasoned plans and social agreements. He invented it.
            </p>
            <p>
              While Socrates practiced getting people to realize that what they found salient was getting way ahead of what they understood to be true, Plato offered a rational explanation.
            </p>
            <p>
              Plato had the great idea that the man can learn and theorize, he can train the lion, and the man and the lion together can tame the monster. This is an optimization strategy, and you want each part to operate as fully as possible without hurting the others. This brings a fullness of being and peace for Plato, and it represents a meta-drive for humans: we want to have what we are having but to be at peace, without inner-conflict.
            </p>
            <p>
              It doesn't go without saying that this path to fullness of being or inner-justice is a positive feedback loop. The more the man learns and trains the lion, the less self-deception and violence obscure the man and lion's path, the more the monster can be tamed. This will be further explained in <a href="#the-allegory-of-the-cave" >The Allegory of the Cave</a>.

              Cognitive Discounting
            </h3>
            <p>
              The relative strength or salience of each part of your psyche, as described by Plato, is found across species. In fact it's very adaptive, and it accounts for something called cognitive discounting.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is your automatic reduction in the salience of a stimulus. Things in the future are much less salient to you than things in the present. A lion now is a much more important fact than a lion in two weeks. If the lion two weeks from now were more important than the one in front of you, you wouldn't last very long at all.
            </p>
            <p>
              This makes sense because any single event in the future, as it gets further away, becomes less likely—there are simply more things that could happen. If this wasn't functioning properly, you wouldn't get out of bed, because you'd be thinking that you might twist your ankle, which would slow you down to class, and if you're late to class you might get worse grades, fail your career and wind up married to a lamp in Buffallo. That end result which is highly unlikely should not be as salient to you as getting up out of bed. Generalized anxiety disorder might be a failure of this kind.
            </p>
            <p>
              But what we need is a way to realize the abstract similarities of particular end results. The likelihood of each particular future death, if you were to start smoking now, is low, but we need to be able to realize that there are a great many of those particular deaths, realize that they are all related to present actions, and treat them as accordingly important.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is a basic problem with adaptive machinery. They work short term and concretely but blind you to what low probability things abstractly have in common.
            </p>
            <p>
              The unavoidable reality is that you can't throw away the adaptive machinery, and you can't just let it run unfettered, because then you harm yourself. What you need is an ability to form abstract thoughts about the future and symbolically represent it to yourself such that it can become salient to you now. This is the function of Plato's man in your head.

            <p>
              This is a mythological framework for enlightenment in Plato's psychology which places the path towards inner-peace into the Axial Revolution's two world's mythology. You are inside the cave, but as you ascend, you're blinded and your eyes need time to adjust, then you go a little further, until you reach the surface and attempt to understand the cause of things, of appearances, to get at the shining source of things, the sun, which you cannot stare at or understand directly.

            <p>
              This is the Platonic form, and it's crucial to understand the allegory of the cave and it's relationship with Pythagoras. The eidos of a thing is not its form or idea, it is a real pattern in reality, like a paradigm, and, when you understand the eidos of a thing, you know the thing.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is similar to what we have found with gestalt or logos. A bird is not a feature-list. If I put wings, hollow bones, eyes, and feathers on a table and thow it up in the air, it's not a bird, it's just a bloody mess. Yet you know what a bird is and it comes from your understanding of the structural-functional organization of the features present in a bird. This is gestalt or logos. If I ask you to explain the gestalt or logos, you cannot, yet you know what it is. This is the closest understanding of eidos.
            </p>
            <p>
              Yet it is only once you understand this eidos that you actually really know what a bird is. It is at once what makes a thing itself and what gives your mind access to understanding it, how your mind can <em>conform</em> to the thing.

              Anagoge is the term that Plato uses to refer to the sort of feedback loop involved in the Allegory of the Cave. It is like an insight-cascade, as you increase your inner-peace, you increase your self knowledge and reduce self-deception, which in turn increases inner-peace and so on. Wisdom is anagogic for Plato.

          </h3>
          <p>
            Aristotle layed the foundation for further aspects of a scientific approach to wisdom and meaning and an important formulation of a way we deeply connect the self to reality.
          </p>
          <p>
            He studied with Plato at the Academy for 20 years and eventually breaks away from him with his famous remark: "I love Plato, but I love the truth more." Aristotle thought that Plato's account of what makes something real for us, the eidos, was great, but that Plato did not adequately account for change.
          </p>
          <p>
            Being the son of a physician, Aristotle is much more easily drawn to biological analogies, rather than Plato's mathematical ones. As such, Aristotle's word for change is better translated as growth or development, which already hints at the connections to a meaningful life for us—part of what makes life meaninful is that we are growing and developing.

            </h3>
            <p>
              He wanted to give eidos a dynamic aspect. He noted the role that form had in growth and development. He would use the analogy of artifacts, man-made things, to understand biological things.
            </p>
            <p>
              For example, I can have a block of wood and make it into a chair or a table or a ship. What makes the wood act like a chair as opposed to a table or a ship? This is aristotle's concept of actuality, and it is the origin of the word.
            </p>
            <p>
              But the wood isn't doing nothing, though it has been structurally-functionally organized, informed, to be actually a chair. Aristotle invents the notion of potentiality to explain the other half of the dynamic. The wood is potentially anything, but only when it is given its form is it actually whatever the form makes it.
            </p>
            <p>
              Aristotle argues that living things do this for themselves. A living thing is like a chair that is making itself. Food is potentially you, and through a process you inform it and make it you.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is foundational to understanding how you connect to the world. To understand why, let's leap forward in time to contemporary dynamical systems theory.

                  The Newtonian Causal Explanation
                </h3>
                <p>
                  This is the explanation of event C in terms of an event B which preceeded and caused it, which in turn was preceeded and caused by an event A, etc. This solves a lot of problems, and is super intuitive. One of the problems that it solves is that it clearly explains the vacuousness of circular arguments, and it doesn't allow for them. This idea was brought out by Kant.
                </p>
                <p>
                  However, Kant encountered a problem with this model. He saw a tree. It isn't an accident that this is the very type of thing that Aristotle liked to deal with and use in his analogies. A tree doesn't folllow the Newtonian causal model because the tree makes the leaves and the leaves make the tree. It's a feedback cycle. Kant then coins the term self-organizing. Kant makes the claim then that biology is an impossible science. This isn't something to be taken lightly. If trees are self-organizing and involve feedback cycles, then they involve circular causal relationships, which are vacuous. So where did Kant go wrong?

                  Constraints and Causes
                </h3>
                <p>
                  It would seem obvious that, if I were to push a round marker on a flat table, it would roll. And why? Because I pushed it. This is the Newtonian answer to the question. But think now about the <em>preconditions</em> of its movement—its round shape, the flatness of the table, the empty space in front of the marker. These things aren't events, but they are certainly necessary for the cause of my pushing the marker to acutally cause its movement.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Alicia Juarrero makes the distinction between causes and constraints. Causes are events that happen, but constraints are conditions that make things possible or impossible. The Newtonian view focused so much on the causes that it lost sight of the constraints. But Aristotle, being largely a Platonist, actually treated the constraints as more important, because the constraints are the eidos, the structural-functional organization, the form of goings on. Things are organized such that motion for this marker is possible, etc. The causes are where you get actuality and the preconditions or constraints are where you get potentiality.
                </p>
                <p>
                  But let's come back to the tree. There's a positive feedback loop of biochemical events or causes, whcih actually cause a particular form or structural-functional organization. Why do trees spread out their branches and leaves? Because they're trying to change the probability of a photon hitting a chlorophyl molecule. The events cause the structure which constrains, which shape the possibility or probability of events. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  Living things have events happening in them that create a gestalt which makes a probability difference between inside and out. Now it's not a circular explanation because we're talking about two different things, actuality and potentiality.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It's important to realize that this potentiality isn't so abstract. In fact, it's integral to modern science. Modern science depends on potentiality being a real thing. If you pick up a weight then stop with it in the air, where did all the kinetic energy go? It became potential energy. To preserve the conservation of matter and energy, we need potentiality to be real.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Furthermore, consider the Newton's formula for force, F=MA. Is this an event? When does it happen? Every Tuesday at four o-clock? This is a constraint, something that constrains events.

                <p>
                  Juarrero isn't done however, she further distinguishes between two types of constrains. Those that increase the likelihood of or make possible certain events are enabling constraints, while those which decrease the probability of or prohibit certain events are selective constraints. Let's use the ideas to talk about one of the most significant scientific theories of growth and development.

                <p>
                  This is the first theory which makes use of dynamical systems theory. First there's the feedback cycle of reproduction, it's goats that produce goats, then there's a selective constraint, scarcity of resources, then there's an eneabling constraint, considerable genetic variation. There's a dynamic cycle between a selective closing in on the options the system has and an eneabling opening up of those actions. And through it all, organisms become better fitted to their environments.

                </h3>
                <p>
                  Juarrero labels selective constrains on a feedback loop virtual governors, and she stops there, but Vervaeke along with some others think she should finish the metaphor. Enabling constraints on a feedback cycle we will call a virtual generator, and a virtual generator together with a virtual governor we will call a virtual engine. Dynamical systems theory concerns explicating virtual engines, in other words where there's a systematic relation between enabling and selective constraints on a feedback cycle.

              <h3>
                Aristotelian Character
              </h3>
              <p>
                This is something we use in our language, but something the depth of which we don't fully understand. There's an aspect of who and what we are that's connected to our projects of meaning and wisdom, you've used the term or related terms: your character. It's not your personality, <em>that</em> you're born with and have no choice over. But you can cultivate your character, either unconsciously or more explicitly, So what is it? When we say someone is acting out of character, we're usually making an existential or moral criticism of them. They're normally honest, they normally have the virtue of honesty—this connection between virtue and virtual engines is not happenstance. When you talk about a virtue you're not talking about an event, you're talking about a set of constraints and preconditions which have been systematically cultivated in somebody. That points to something, when we're talking about character, we're talking about the virtual engine on someone's development. What system of constraints have you identified with and internalized that regulate your development.
              </p>
              <p>
                Let's ask a socratic question: we spend a lot of time on our appearances, on our status, how much time did we spend today on our characters? How much? If it is the virtual engine regulating your growth and development, you should be spending a lot of time on it. Are you? Aristotle's method of the golden mean is a way to get you to set up conditions to cultivate your character. What is courage? Aristotle proposed that it's the golden mean between cowardice and foolhardiness. So what you're trying to do is set up a system where you're recognizing when you don't have enough generation and also when you lack the selective constraints, you have to train yourself by engaging in practices that slowly, over time will create a virtual engine. You are the source of your actions that modify your environment which feeds back and changes you, and again, and again. So the question is: are you just letting that happen to you, or are you actively trying to cultivate your character? 
              </p>
              <p>
                We don't get the depths of what we're saying here, one of the most prescient criticisms we can of ourselves and of others is "they aren't living up to their potential." Part of what makes your life meaningful is you have cultivated character that allows you to actualize your potential, a virtual engine that regulates your development in a way in which you grow up, you improve, so that your potential is fully realized.

                Wisdom
              </h3>
              <p>
                Aristotle brings in this notion of development and growth to the constitution of a meaningful life. Wisdom becomes the ability to cultivate virtues, or a virtual engine which leads to the actualization of potential. And he points out that there's a deep form of foolishness that comes from a lack of character called akrasia, which we poorly translate as a weakness of will—because we're all post-protestants and we think the will is our central thing even though there's growing scientific evidence that the will is a defunct idea and that we should give it up.
              </p>
              <p>
                Here's where we can put Aristotle and Plato together. Plato gives us a story of how we have to structure the psyche, but Aristotle gives us a much more penetrating analysis of the structural-functional organization of the psyche. Plato would say ignorance is when you do the wrong thing because you don't know, and foolishness is when you know what the right thing is but still do the wrong thing, but Aristotle would say, though you have the right beliefs, you don't have sufficient character—that you have not trained the skill and sensitivities, you have not a virtual engine regulating your development and growth such that you will live up to your potential and actualize yourself to do the right thing.

              <h3>
                Purpose & The Hierarchy of Beings
              </h3>
              <p>
                Why does living up to your potential matter so much? Let's go back to the analogy of the man made thing. What makes something well-made? What makes some knife a good knife?
              </p>
              <p>
                Well, when it has a structural functional organization that allows it to fulfill its purpose. Knives are for cutting, and if I arrange the metal the right way, the handle, the leverage, it will cut well. Notice also that purpose is really important to us for meaning. But since humans aren't made like knives, since we make ourselves, we are autopoeitic. This is a concept from Evan Thomson. You're different from a tornado (which will move into conditions which destroy it). You will seek out conditions that protect and promote yourself. Here's the best part, in living things, it's purpose is its structural functional organization. You're purpose is to enhance your structural functional organization. For anistotle this means paying attention to the fact that you are a rational reflective creature.
              </p>
              <p>
                You have matter, which is informed to a living thing, which is informed to a self-moving thing, which is informed, more actualized, into a self-making. But you can perform the axial revolution on yourself, you can actualize your self-making and become a rational thing.
              </p>
              <p>
                Living up to your potential is to make sure you've cultivated a character that takes you as high on this hierarchy as possible. Someone that lived only as a plant or animal, would be a debauched, failed human being. But someone who is merely self-making but not rational? Maybe. You must cultivate your character to become a rational, moral human being. You become a good person if you actualize, inform, your being with a virtual engine that realizes those things which are distinctive of your humanity. You <em>realize</em> what makes humans different. Why am I more valuable that the table in front of me? Why do I matter more? Because there are things found in rational beings which aren't found in merely mental beings or animals or plants or matter—things which we find intrinsically valuable.
              </p>
              <p>
                What are those things? Here's where Aristotle gives the Axial answer: our capacity for overcoming self-deception, for cultivating our characters, for realizing wisdom, and for enhancing the structure of our contact with reality.
              </p>
              <p>
                Your purpose is to become as fully human as possible. How are you cultivating your character to do so? How much of your life is dedicated to creating a virtual engine that realizes your rational capacities, those things that make you most human in contrast to all the other things around you.
              </p>
              <p>
                One of the things we could use today is to go back to Aristotle, to rejuvenate and reanimate these terms like character, growth, and development that have become trite and superficial. We talk in no other terms, we don't have any others, but they have no real depth for us. We can use Aristotle to deepen what these terms mean for us.
