  <h2>
    Upper Paleolithic Transition
  </h2>
  <div class="summary" markdown="1">
### 40,000 BCE

The Upper Paleolithic has the earliest known evidence of organized
settlements, in the form of campsites, some with storage pits.
Artistic work blossomed, with cave painting, petroglyphs, carvings and
engravings on bone or ivory. The first evidence of human fishing is
also found, from artefacts in places such as Blombos cave in South
Africa. More complex social groupings emerged, supported by more
varied and reliable food sources and specialized tool types. This
probably contributed to increasing group identification or ethnicity
(from Wikipedia).

          Shamanism
        </h3>
        <blockquote>
          "One thing's for sure: shamaism is the best medical care you're
          going to get for a long time."
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Shamanism begins around this time. The shaman engages in
          disruptive practices, participatory play, and psychedelics to
          heal, lead, and cousel their tribespeople. They harness the
          <a class="link" href="#the-flow-state">flow-state</a> and implicit
          learning to have intuitive understandings of patterns in their
          environments and in the tribe.
        </p>
        <p>
          The shaman is getting into the flow state, getting an insight
          cascade and super-enhanced implicit learning, picking up on real,
          complex patterns in the environment. These two things reinforce
          each other. but some challenges arise.
        </p>
        <p>
          They don't know how they're doing it, they're transcending
          themselves, they have intuitive insights—healing people, how the
          dear moves, etc.—and they can't communicate any of their
          knowledge. The shaman is healing and transforming people, they're
          dancing, singing, and chanting, and it's is making meaning.
          They're altering people's sense of what matters.
        </p>
        <p>
          The brain is putting different parts of itself in communication
          with each other. Normally this would be experienced as noise, but
          with enhanced insight and cognitive processing, its experienced as
          a bridging force, further augmenting pattern recognition. This is
          the capacity for metaphor.
        </p>
        <p>
          This makes shamans generators of metaphor: literally providing
          people with the forms of thought that will allow them to connect
          ideas, such that making inscriptions on caves can track the moon,
          that making a figure will connect you with fertility. They often
          experience soul flight (origin of getting high and the metaphor
          behind the words oversight and supervision).

        <h3 id="the-flow-state">
          The Flow-State
        </h3>
        <p>
          The flow-state happens when: your task is beyond your present
          abilities but not your insights, the task gets harder as your
          abilities improve, coupling between yourself and the task is
          tight, feedback is clear, and failure is meaningful.
        </p>
        <p>
          This state is deeply positive for people, and not becuase it's
          pleasurable. The more time you spend in the flow-state, the more
          likely you are to say your own life is meaningful. Whilst in it,
          you feel deeply at one with things, your actions spontaneously
          flow out of you, time passes differently, your narrative
          self-conscious quiets, the task is super-salient, and, while at
          one level, there is tremendous metabolic effort, it feels
          effortless.
        </p>
        <p>
          People really like this experience. It seems to be not only
          meaningful, but also where they do their best work. Additionally,
          the flow-state is a universal. Almost everyone from every culture
          reports this state in similar terms. Universals are important
          because they give us clues as to the underlying machinery.
        </p>
        <p>
          This underlying machinery (according to Vervaeke and Ferraro)
          involves transframing, or the process of breaking and reframing
          the task. An example of this is rock climbing. When you're stuck,
          you're physically stuck, and you have to physically reframe
          yourself on the face to move forward.

          Implicit Learning & Intuition
        </h3>
        <p>
          Implicit learning is a capacity, outside of your conscious
          awareness, to pick up on very complicated patterns in your
          environment. Arthur Reber (60s) conducted an experiment with two
          sets of random rules for generating long strings, asking people to
          sort them into sets. They performed well above chance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hogarth, in <em>Educating Intuition</em>, says that what we call
          intuition is real, but that there isn't anything magical about it.
          It's just the result of your implicit learning. We call it
          intuition is when it's going well, and bias or prejudice is when
          it's going wrong. He argues that the difference lies in the kind
          of pattern picked up.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are two kinds of pattern in your environment: correlational
          and causal. The bigot has picked up on
          <em>correlational</em> patterns, not causal patterns. You need to
          train your implicit learning to look for causal patterns. But you
          cannot be told to look for patterns or your performance gets
          worse. Implicit learning cannot be replaced by explicit
          learning—its being implicit is why is works so well. What we can
          do is set up the right context, the right environmental factors,
          so that the implicit learning machine can get onto causal rather
          than correlational patterns. (Science is a way to do precisely
          this.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Hogarth says that implicit learning can be encouraged by a
          situation in which the coupling between you and the world is
          tight, feedback is clear, and failure is meaningful—exactly the
          same requirements for the flow-state.

        The Continuous Cosmos
      </h3>
      <p>
        In the Bronze Age, the world was mythologized and experienced as a
        continuous cosmos. People experienced themselves in radical
        continuity and connectedness with eachother and the environment.
        Furthermore, this continuity was extended between the natural world,
        the cultural world, and the divine world. In other words, there was
        not a difference in kind, only in power, between trees, animals,
        humans, and gods.
      </p>
      <p>
        Glorious is the word most used to describe God in the Bible. It
        means only shining with power. There is no moral or riteous quality
        to it. The pharos are God-kings, something <em>like</em> a god. It's
        not a metaphor for the Egyptians, there's just a difference in
        power.
      </p>
      <p>
        But this cosmos is continuous in another way: it folds on itself.
        Time moves in large cycles that repeat for eternity, and ritual
        behavior is an attempt to get back to the original power of
        creation—to tap into that creative power. There's a constant
        nostalgia to get back, to fit into the cycles, beacause if you
        change your future too much, you undermine your past.

      <p>
        In the land of Kanin, later taken to the Hebrew, Phoenicians, and

        It's a more efficient and effective

        it's far easier to learn. Since literacy is so powerful, and the

        everyone can reflect, become more aware of their own thoughts, their
        own past errors in thinking. People start to get a capacity for
        second order thinking.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is your capacity to internalize literacy into your

        cognition, how much they can transcend themselves, and how
        self-deceptive they can be. There begins a titanic shift in focus

          We still are filled with the God-grammar of the Bible, and this

          existential sense of being as well. This is important because the
          Hebrews are about to invent a powerful psychotechnology called
          progress.
        </p>
        <p>
          Progress exapts our capacity for storytelling and uses it to
          understand time and moral participation in history. It claims that
          time is a story, a narrative, that it has a beginning, a turning
          point, and a resolution, that there's a direction and a purpose to
          it. The continuous cosmos did not have an open future; this does.
          The continuous cosmos had no purpose to it; this does.
        </p>
        <p>
          The way that your actions change your future is by your
          participation in the story. There is an ongoing creation through
          history. Since story operates through meaning and moraltiy, the
          morality of your actions changes the future. This is exemplified

          Kairos is the technical term for these turning points the in the
          narrative of time in which one can participate with God in the
          creation of the future. They involve a particular kind of faith:
          da'ath. This is the sort of participatory knowing which is used as
          a biblical metaphor for sex. You shape it, and it shapes you,
          there's a turning point and a climax, a course.
        </p>
        <p>
          You have this sort of knowing with respect to questions like: How
          are things going? Is this relationship progressing? Am I growing
          as a person? This is da'ath. You know it by identifying with it.

        <p>
          Tresspassing is walking off the moral course of history, a
          movement backwards, away from the promised land. This is what it
          means to sin, and this is Christianity's answer to the problem of
          self-deception—that we sin, decieve ourselves, constantly without
          knowing it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since, periodically, God has to intervene in the course of things,
          prophets become central. Prophecy is not someone telling the
          future; it's when you and your loved one go to therapy, and the
          therapist says something that wakes you up, that makes you realize
          how you can get back on track.
        </p>
        <p>
          All of this begins to craft a focus on remembering God,
          participating in the ongoing creation of the world, helping your
          neighbors, yourself, and your culture to live up to its promise.
          Do you feel like you're living up to your promise? If this is
          important to you, then you use the grammar of the Hebrews.

        <p>
          What the Christians uniquely claimed was that kairos was found in

He discovers that these new psychotechnologies of rational argumentation give us access to abstract patterns we are not directly aware of. He takes this idea of realizing abstract patterns and links them to the shamanic practices, saying we are somehow trapped in this world, but that we can learn to fly free, like the shaman.

          He linked the path of self-transcendence to the realization of abstract patterns. He gives us words like cosmos (seen in cosmetics: to reveal the beauty of things). Pythagoras said that following him would lead to our transcending ourselves, experiencing the world as ordered and beautiful. Thus, shamanic soul flight is transformed into a radical self-transcendence towards the real world that dictates the abstract figures of reality.

      <div class="summary">
        <p>
          Socrates was an enigmatic, provocative, and maddeningly frustrating figure. He is equally so with respect to scholarly attempts to get clear on his history. Some followers of his went to the oracle at Delphi and asked whether there was any man wiser than Socrates. They were shocked when, as opposed to the regular, unintelligible answer, the recieved "No. There is no man wiser than Socrates".  
        </p>
        <p>
          Socrates's way of taking this answer is telling. He did not pat himself on the back. He asked how it could be so, and he began a quest to find out.
        </p>
        <p>
          He presents us with an interesting character, which appears to have been shamanic to a large extent, carrying on the mythos of the shamanic psychotechnologies: long meditations, inhuman bravery and ability to withstand pain, cold, and hunger. But he also represents a turning point in world history and is the figure of the Axial Revolution in Greece.

            Elenchus & Aporia
          </h3>
          <p>
            Elenchus is the name given to the Socratic Method. Socrates would go to anyone claiming to have wisdom or knowledge, or to any tradesman, nobleman, etc., and ask them questions. "Why are you buying those goods? Oh, because they will bring you pleasure? Then you must know what pleasure is, please, tell me? And how can you tell which among them is good as opposed to bad, surely you must know what the good is?" and so on.
          </p>
          <p>
            The state that his interlocutors eventually reached is called aporia. It's like being stung by a sting ray, confused, lost, paralyzed, utterly unable to continue the discussion. Socrates believed at some point to have completed his quest. He knew what he did not know. Not in the sense that one does not know the intricacies of quantum physics, but in the sense of <a href="#kairos-&-daath" class="link">da'ath</a>. Socrates has a deep sense of his own cognitive mechanisms and how self-deceptive they can be.
          </p>
          <p>
            Socrates had figured out that our actions are constantly racing ahead of our knowledge. We are buying things, and we <em>don't know why</em>. We want and we do and we get angry and we fall in love and we <em>don't know what's going on</em>.

            Thales
          </h3>
          <p>
            The Natural Philosophers, of whom Thales is a prime example, were one of the groups that Socrates sought out on his quest. Thales' body of work, of which we have only fragments, can be summed up in three lines.
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            All is the moist.
            The loadstone has psyche.
            Everything is filled with Gods.
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            Thales first inquires about the substance of everything, about getting in and underneath the world, to figure out what it's made of. And there's no myth here; this is not a story, not a narrative explanation, he's making a rational, empirical attempt to understand the cosmos. What he's inventing is scientific thought.
          </p>
          <p>
            The last line could be misread easily by modern eyes. Thales is attempting to communicate the awe and wonder that analysis into the fabric of reality, into making sense of reality, of what's most sacred and inexhaustible, provokes. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Ultimately, Socrates rejects the natural philosophers, such as Thales, because they offer <a href="truth-&-relevance" class="link">truth without relevance</a>. Thales tells us nothing of how we should live our lives, of what's important to us, of what moves us, etc.

            The Sophists & Rhetoric
          </h3>
          <p>
            The sophists (where we get the word sophisticated) were a group of people trained in the new, very Greek, psychotechnology of rhetoric, or argumentative skill. They did not care what the argument was for, only that it could be delivered well. See <a href="#bullshit" class="link">bullshit</a> for more information.
          </p>
          <p>
            They were paid to teach citizens and prepare their speeches for democratic presentation. They would teach one man to argue for an augmentation of the Athenian navy and another for its diminuation. Socrates ultimately rejects the sophists as well, as they offer <a href="truth-&-relevance" class="link">relevance without truth</a>.

            Bullshit
          </h3>
          <p>
            Socrates understood that while we cannot lie to ourselves, we can bullshit ourselves. You cannot volitionally believe. If asked to believe there's an elephant in the room, though you know there is not. You cannot do it. The liar thus depends on your commitment to the truth. And, though you can direct your attention, it can also be caught. The bullshit artist depends on your self-deception, on your sense of salience, on your caught attention, overpowering your commitment to the truth.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is a feedback loop which occurs with attention: your attention is captured by something, so it becomes more salient in the future, you are more caught by it, so it is more salient, and so on until you loose the capacity to notice or think about other things. This is the engine of bullshit.
          </p>
          <p>
            Rhetoric is a psychotechnology of bullshit. It is the explicit, trained capacity to bullshit your listeners. It is the beginning of advertising. You know that life is not like a beer commercial. If you walked into a bar, and it was like a beer commercial, you would question your sanity. Nonetheless, you buy the beer, the advertisement is still effective; the reason is rhetoric and our capacity for our actions and desires to become very salient to us way before we understand them, our capacity to bullshit ourselves and to be bullshit by others.

            Truth & Relevance
          </h3>
          <p>
            While the natural philosophers offered truth without relevance, and the sophists relevance without truth, Socrates wanted truth and relevance to become aligned. He thought that what makes life worth living is caring about the things which matter, finding relevant, desireable, and tempting things which are actually known by onself to be truly good.
          </p>
          <p>
            Socrates claimed that he knew how to love well (ta erotika), or desire or want well. In short he claims to have gotten his relevance machinery and his truth oriented-ness to work together. He knew how reason and love go together.
