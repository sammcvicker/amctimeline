  <h2>
    Upper Paleolithic Transition
  </h2>
  <div class="summary" markdown="1">
### 40,000 BCE

The Upper Paleolithic has the earliest known evidence of organized
settlements, in the form of campsites, some with storage pits.
Artistic work blossomed, with cave painting, petroglyphs, carvings and
engravings on bone or ivory. The first evidence of human fishing is
also found, from artefacts in places such as Blombos cave in South
Africa. More complex social groupings emerged, supported by more
varied and reliable food sources and specialized tool types. This
probably contributed to increasing group identification or ethnicity
(from Wikipedia).

          Shamanism
        </h3>
        <blockquote>
          "One thing's for sure: shamaism is the best medical care you're
          going to get for a long time."
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Shamanism begins around this time. The shaman engages in
          disruptive practices, participatory play, and psychedelics to
          heal, lead, and cousel their tribespeople. They harness the
          <a class="link" href="#the-flow-state">flow-state</a> and implicit
          learning to have intuitive understandings of patterns in their
          environments and in the tribe.
        </p>
        <p>
          The shaman is getting into the flow state, getting an insight
          cascade and super-enhanced implicit learning, picking up on real,
          complex patterns in the environment. These two things reinforce
          each other. but some challenges arise.
        </p>
        <p>
          They don't know how they're doing it, they're transcending
          themselves, they have intuitive insights—healing people, how the
          dear moves, etc.—and they can't communicate any of their
          knowledge. The shaman is healing and transforming people, they're
          dancing, singing, and chanting, and it's is making meaning.
          They're altering people's sense of what matters.
        </p>
        <p>
          The brain is putting different parts of itself in communication
          with each other. Normally this would be experienced as noise, but
          with enhanced insight and cognitive processing, its experienced as
          a bridging force, further augmenting pattern recognition. This is
          the capacity for metaphor.
        </p>
        <p>
          This makes shamans generators of metaphor: literally providing
          people with the forms of thought that will allow them to connect
          ideas, such that making inscriptions on caves can track the moon,
          that making a figure will connect you with fertility. They often
          experience soul flight (origin of getting high and the metaphor
          behind the words oversight and supervision).

        <h3 id="the-flow-state">
          The Flow-State
        </h3>
        <p>
          The flow-state happens when: your task is beyond your present
          abilities but not your insights, the task gets harder as your
          abilities improve, coupling between yourself and the task is
          tight, feedback is clear, and failure is meaningful.
        </p>
        <p>
          This state is deeply positive for people, and not becuase it's
          pleasurable. The more time you spend in the flow-state, the more
          likely you are to say your own life is meaningful. Whilst in it,
          you feel deeply at one with things, your actions spontaneously
          flow out of you, time passes differently, your narrative
          self-conscious quiets, the task is super-salient, and, while at
          one level, there is tremendous metabolic effort, it feels
          effortless.
        </p>
        <p>
          People really like this experience. It seems to be not only
          meaningful, but also where they do their best work. Additionally,
          the flow-state is a universal. Almost everyone from every culture
          reports this state in similar terms. Universals are important
          because they give us clues as to the underlying machinery.
        </p>
        <p>
          This underlying machinery (according to Vervaeke and Ferraro)
          involves transframing, or the process of breaking and reframing
          the task. An example of this is rock climbing. When you're stuck,
          you're physically stuck, and you have to physically reframe
          yourself on the face to move forward.

          Implicit Learning & Intuition
        </h3>
        <p>
          Implicit learning is a capacity, outside of your conscious
          awareness, to pick up on very complicated patterns in your
          environment. Arthur Reber (60s) conducted an experiment with two
          sets of random rules for generating long strings, asking people to
          sort them into sets. They performed well above chance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hogarth, in <em>Educating Intuition</em>, says that what we call
          intuition is real, but that there isn't anything magical about it.
          It's just the result of your implicit learning. We call it
          intuition is when it's going well, and bias or prejudice is when
          it's going wrong. He argues that the difference lies in the kind
          of pattern picked up.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are two kinds of pattern in your environment: correlational
          and causal. The bigot has picked up on
          <em>correlational</em> patterns, not causal patterns. You need to
          train your implicit learning to look for causal patterns. But you
          cannot be told to look for patterns or your performance gets
          worse. Implicit learning cannot be replaced by explicit
          learning—its being implicit is why is works so well. What we can
          do is set up the right context, the right environmental factors,
          so that the implicit learning machine can get onto causal rather
          than correlational patterns. (Science is a way to do precisely
          this.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Hogarth says that implicit learning can be encouraged by a
          situation in which the coupling between you and the world is
          tight, feedback is clear, and failure is meaningful—exactly the
          same requirements for the flow-state.

        The Continuous Cosmos
      </h3>
      <p>
        In the Bronze Age, the world was mythologized and experienced as a
        continuous cosmos. People experienced themselves in radical
        continuity and connectedness with eachother and the environment.
        Furthermore, this continuity was extended between the natural world,
        the cultural world, and the divine world. In other words, there was
        not a difference in kind, only in power, between trees, animals,
        humans, and gods.
      </p>
      <p>
        Glorious is the word most used to describe God in the Bible. It
        means only shining with power. There is no moral or riteous quality
        to it. The pharos are God-kings, something <em>like</em> a god. It's
        not a metaphor for the Egyptians, there's just a difference in
        power.
      </p>
      <p>
        But this cosmos is continuous in another way: it folds on itself.
        Time moves in large cycles that repeat for eternity, and ritual
        behavior is an attempt to get back to the original power of
        creation—to tap into that creative power. There's a constant
        nostalgia to get back, to fit into the cycles, beacause if you
        change your future too much, you undermine your past.

        This was the greatest collapse of civilization the world has ever

        than at any other time in history. This is the closest thing to

      <p>
        In the land of Kanin, later taken to the Hebrew, Phoenicians, and

        It's a more efficient and effective

        it's far easier to learn. Since literacy is so powerful, and the
        number of literate people increases, the effect is titanic. Almost
        everyone can reflect, become more aware of their own thoughts, their
        own past errors in thinking. People start to get a capacity for
        second order thinking.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is your capacity to internalize literacy into your
        metacognition. You can reflect, correct, store, share, your

        things about their cognition: how much they can correct their
        cognition, how much they can transcend themselves, and how
        self-deceptive they can be. There begins a titanic shift in focus

        the <em>real</em> world of the trained mind, the wise mind, being in

        no continuity, no connection. We begin to get the sense that we are

          of your thought."
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          We still are filled with the God-grammar of the Bible, and this
          grammar has become not only part of your cognition but of your
          existential sense of being as well. This is important because the
          Hebrews are about to invent a powerful psychotechnology called
          progress.
        </p>
        <p>
          Progress exapts our capacity for storytelling and uses it to
          understand time and moral participation in history. It claims that
          time is a story, a narrative, that it has a beginning, a turning
          point, and a resolution, that there's a direction and a purpose to
          it. The continuous cosmos did not have an open future; this does.
          The continuous cosmos had no purpose to it; this does.
        </p>
        <p>
          The way that your actions change your future is by your
          participation in the story. There is an ongoing creation through
          history. Since story operates through meaning and moraltiy, the
          morality of your actions changes the future. This is exemplified
          in the story of Exodus.

          The Jews are imprisoned in the epitome of the everyday world, and

          be localized, to be imprisoned. His name is eventually "I will be

          Kairos is the technical term for these turning points the in the
          narrative of time in which one can participate with God in the
          creation of the future. They involve a particular kind of faith:
          da'ath. This is the sort of participatory knowing which is used as
          a biblical metaphor for sex. You shape it, and it shapes you,
          there's a turning point and a climax, a course.
        </p>
        <p>
          You have this sort of knowing with respect to questions like: How
          are things going? Is this relationship progressing? Am I growing
          as a person? This is da'ath. You know it by identifying with it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tresspassing is walking off the moral course of history, a
          movement backwards, away from the promised land. This is what it
          means to sin, and this is Christianity's answer to the problem of
          self-deception—that we sin, decieve ourselves, constantly without
          knowing it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since, periodically, God has to intervene in the course of things,
          prophets become central. Prophecy is not someone telling the
          future; it's when you and your loved one go to therapy, and the
          therapist says something that wakes you up, that makes you realize
          how you can get back on track.
        </p>
        <p>
          All of this begins to craft a focus on remembering God,
          participating in the ongoing creation of the world, helping your
          neighbors, yourself, and your culture to live up to its promise.
          Do you feel like you're living up to your promise? If this is
          important to you, then you use the grammar of the Hebrews.

        <p>
          What the Christians uniquely claimed was that kairos was found in
          a particular person, personalizing all of this in a peculiar way.
